# HealthConnect Assignment

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JulianoJk/HealthConnectAssigment.git`

2. Navigate to the root folder of the project: `cd HealthConnectAssigment`

3. Run the following command to start both the frontend and backend using Docker Compose: `docker-compose up`
 
This command will build and start the Docker containers for the frontend and backend services.

4. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the frontend application by opening your web browser and visiting: `http://localhost:3000`


This will load the front-end application in your browser, allowing you to interact with it.

That's it! You should now be able to run the project using Docker Compose and access the frontend application through `localhost:3000`.
